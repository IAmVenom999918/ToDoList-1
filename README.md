Task Class: Start by creating a 'Task' class to represent individual tasks. Each task can have attributes like a title, description, due date, etc.

Task Manager Class: Create a 'TaskManager' class that will manage all the tasks. This class should have methods to add tasks, remove tasks, mark tasks as completed, display all tasks, display tasks by priority or due date, etc.

User Interface: You can create a simple command-line interface (CLI) where users can interact with your task manager. Allow them to add tasks, remove tasks, mark tasks as completed, and view their tasks in different ways.

Persistence: Optionally, you can add functionality to save tasks to a file so that users can access them even after closing the application. You can use JSON or a simple text format for this purpose.
